SOL - Simple Object-oriented language

Every programmer dreams of his own perfect programming language.
Back in the mid 90s when I was a young teenager I designed and implemented
my first own programming language as a hobby project.
I'd called it SOL, not knowning there was another Brasilian programming language with same name.
The language is influenced by Smalltalk - which was still in vouge at that time - and CLOS (Common Lisp Object System).
In contrast to Smalltalk it supports generic methods and multiple inheritance.

I've recently found a copy of my old code on backup disks.
Surprisingly, it still compiles and runs flawlessly on OSX despite being written on a good old 16bit DOS 486/Pentium machine using Turbo C++ (and later ported to 32bit Windows using Wacom C++).
I've decided to release it under GPL, as it is a nice example of a minimal compiler and VM,
and could be used as a base for your own language.

Feel free to ask me for more details (unfortunately I couldn't find my old German notes).
